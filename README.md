CASS: Conservative Adaptive Synthetic Sampling for Tool Wear State identification


## Code
This repository contains sample code that implements Conservative Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (CASS). 
The first file, CASS.py, is the code for the CASS implementation. The second file, SFROR.py, is the code implementation of the sample feature retention rate and offset rate (SFROR).


## Dataset
We have publicly released the TTD2022 public turning tool dataset to scholars worldwide, 
and TTD2022 is publicly available for free at:
 http://mad-net.cn:8765.


## Dependencies
The code was written with: Python 3.7.0; Numpy 1.21.2; pandas 1.1.5; Matplotlib 3.4.2; and Scikit learn 0.23.2.
